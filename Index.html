        <p>
          Roselle is a tropical shrub with green leaves and a red stalk. It is an annual. They are also known as Hibiscus Sabdariffa and are native to Africa. They grow well in USDA Zones 8-11. However, they can be started indoors as far north as Zone 6 and transplanted outside when the risk of freeze has gone. They are sensitive to frosts and freezes so plant accordingly to your area.

    <p>It is better to plant these in the ground as they can get tall and need room for roots. They are not super picky about soil as mine are grown in sandy soil of Southwest Florida. They need full sun to help grow flowers that turn into fruit, called calyces. Remember to save the seeds from inside the calyces so that you can plant again next year!
